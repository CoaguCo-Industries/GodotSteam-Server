Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below. API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older version.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---|---
1.59 or newer | 3.2 or newer
1.58a or older | 3.1 or older

Known Issues
---
- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strong recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.

"Quick" How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the Godot 3.x version of GodotSteam Server from scratch, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To Servers' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/server/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam-Server/releases) and skip compiling it yourself!
